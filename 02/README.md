# Advent Day #2

## Notes
This took me WAY longer than it should have, I got caught up spiltting out all the lines, and then summing all the wrong stuff, It's Saturday, I'm hung over, don't judge me. Anyway, once I worked out I could use `max()` it was super easy, code is way more verbose than it needs to be because I was talking it out as I was writing but it works. 

Step two was very simple because I was already using max, just x them all together FTW.
